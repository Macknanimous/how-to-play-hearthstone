                <h2>Introducing Hearthstone</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                Hearthstone is the game that kicked off the digital collectable card game craze and inspired everything from Clash Royale to Artifact. A once-small side project from Blizzard turned into one of the most successful games of the last decade. It spearheaded the trend of having mobile and PC cross-platform play and inspired other major developers, such as Valve and Riot, to release games in the same style for their own successful properties.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hearthstone quickly spawned a competitive scene around it and proved to be one of the most popular games on Twitch, regularly battling the big names such as Dota 2, League of Legends and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive for the top spot on the platform. Prize pools reached six figures very quickly and soon Blizzard started to assert more control over the pro scene. But its popularity meant that, unlike some other titles, a thriving amateur and tier two scene continues to this day.  
            </p>     
            <p>
                Hearthstone is a substantially bigger game than it was when it launched and CCGs are never simple to just pick up and start winning at, but really there's no better time than now to get into Hearthstone. The game is well balanced, the top level scene is still going strong and the pathway to pro is clearer than ever. So here’s where to start.

                <h2>How to Download Hearthstone</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                You’ll need a Blizzard account to sign up and play Hearthstone. Fortunately it’s completely free to sign up and start playing. On a desktop all you have to do is head to the <a href="https://us.battle.net/account/creation/en/tos.html?theme=blizzard&style=PHOENIX&country=USA" target="_blank" id="blizzard_account_link">Blizzard Account Creation page</a>, set up your account and then download the Blizzard Launcher, which will allow you to install Hearthstone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the launcher has downloaded and installed you can simply navigate to the Hearthstone section of the app and hit install. Once the installation is complete you can hit the play button and start your journey to Hearthstone pro.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you prefer to play on a mobile device, then all you have to do is head to the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/hearthstone/id625257520" target="_blank" id="apple_store_link">Apple App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blizzard.wtcg.hearthstone&hl=en_GB" target="_blank" id="google_store_link">Google Play Store</a> and search for Hearthstone. Download the app and boot it up and you're good to go, although you'll also need a Blizzard account to play on mobile.
