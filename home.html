                <h2>Introducing Hearthstone</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                Hearthstone is the game that kicked off the digital collectable card game craze and inspired everything from Clash Royale to Artifact. A once-small side project from Blizzard turned into one of the most successful games of the last decade. It spearheaded the trend of having mobile and PC cross-platform play and inspired other major developers, such as Valve and Riot, to release games in the same style for their own successful properties.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hearthstone quickly spawned a competitive scene around it and proved to be one of the most popular games on Twitch, regularly battling the big names such as Dota 2, League of Legends and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive for the top spot on the platform. Prize pools reached six figures very quickly and soon Blizzard started to assert more control over the pro scene. But its popularity meant that, unlike some other titles, a thriving amateur and tier two scene continues to this day.  
            </p>     
            <p>
                Hearthstone is a substantially bigger game than it was when it launched and CCGs are never simple to just pick up and start winning at, but really there's no better time than now to get into Hearthstone. The game is well balanced, the top level scene is still going strong and the pathway to pro is clearer than ever. So here’s where to start.

                <h2>How to Download Hearthstone</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                You’ll need a Blizzard account to sign up and play Hearthstone. Fortunately it’s completely free to sign up and start playing. On a desktop all you have to do is head to the <a href="https://us.battle.net/account/creation/en/tos.html?theme=blizzard&style=PHOENIX&country=USA" target="_blank" id="blizzard-account-link">Blizzard Account Creation page</a>, set up your account and then download the Blizzard Launcher, which will allow you to install Hearthstone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the launcher has downloaded and installed you can simply navigate to the Hearthstone section of the app and hit install. Once the installation is complete you can hit the play button and start your journey to Hearthstone pro.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you prefer to play on a mobile device, then all you have to do is head to the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/hearthstone/id625257520" target="_blank" id="apple-store-link">Apple App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blizzard.wtcg.hearthstone&hl=en_GB" target="_blank" id="google-store-link">Google Play Store</a> and search for Hearthstone. Download the app and boot it up and you're good to go, although you'll also need a Blizzard account to play on mobile.

            <p>
                Hearthstone is a one-versus-one game where you must take the health of your opponent down from 30 to 0 in order to win. Attacking them directly with units on the board or spells will reduce their health, but some characters and cards can heal them back up. Each player takes a turn to draw a card from their deck into their hand, play any cards they wish and then attack the opponent directly or the minions they have on the board.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each card you play costs mana, with you having a limited amount each turn, meaning you can't play all the best cards in the same turn. Your mana increases by one each turn up to 10, meaning the strongest cards cannot be played until the later rounds.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you progress in your abilities you'll head into the world of deck building, where you can select the cards you want to play with in each match. With thousands of cards to choose from and unlock you could be one amazing deck away from a run at the top level of play and it's discovering new strategies that makes Hearthstone’s deck building so fun.

            <div id="card-rules">
                <p>
                    There are two main types of cards in Hearthstone, minion cards and spell cards. Let's start with the minion card.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The name of the minion appears along the middle of the card.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A description of the minion's mechanics will be displayed on the bottom half of the card, however not all minions have descriptions. In this instance, Aberrant Berserker gains +2 attack when his "Enrage" triggers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bottom middle section of the card will tell you what "tribe" the minion belongs to. Certain tribe cards have synergy with each other, though not all minions belong to a tribe such as this one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the bottom left and right corners of the card, there are numbers. The number on the bottom right represents the minion's health. When this reaches zero, the minion will be removed from the board and is sent to the graveyard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the bottom left, the number in the yellow circle represents the attack value the card has. When this minion attacks other minions or your opponent's character, the health of its target is reduced by this attack value. How minions can attack will be explained later in this tutorial.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moving on to the spell card, the name of which is also in the middle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These cards will always contain a description on its bottom half, describing what the spell does. For example, Academic Espionage when played, will "Shuffle 10 cards from your opponent's class into your deck. They cost (1)."
                </p>
                <p>Both cards have a blue hexagon on the top left containing a number. This represents the mana cost required to play each card.</p>

                Let's finish up by checking out how the first few turns of a typical game of Hearthstone will play out.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>

                    </code>
                    <h4>Pick your Starting Hand</h4>
                    <p>
                        The match begins with a coin toss to determine who goes first, followed by both players drawing their starting hands: three cards for the coin toss winner, four for the other player. Ane because going first does offer a slight strategic advantage, the loser of the coin toss also gets The Coin: a special zero cost card that temporarily increases your mana by one! You can mulligan as many cards from your starting hands as you like. Once both players accept their hand, the match proper begins.
                    </p>

                    </code>
                    <h4>Draw a Card</h4>
                    <p>
                        You draw a card from your deck at the start of each turn, and some cards allow you to draw additional cards during your turn.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>

                    <h4>Play Cards</h4>
                    <p>
                        One mana crystal isn't much, but there are plenty of low cost cards you can play during your first turn. Like this Argent Squire for example. Minions can't attack the turn they are played unless they have the Charge ability, so the squire is taking a nap until it's her turn to act.
                    </p>
                </li>

                    <h4>Attack</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our opponent played a minion, and now it's our turn again. With two mana crystals, we can summon another minion, play a spell, or use our hero power. Decisions, decisions... Our Argent Squire is also ready to attack now; we can attack our opponent, or we can take out his minion. Since our squire has Divine Shield, we could take out the opposing minion without sacrificing our own.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Use your Hero Power</h4>
                    <p>
                        Rogues can summon daggers, so let's grab a knife and use this weapon to take out our opponent's minion, saving our Squire's shield. Weapon-wielding heroes can target heroes or minions, but watch out: each attack costs one point of durability, and once your weapon runs out of durability, it's discarded for good.
                    </p>

                    <h4>End Your Turn</h4>
                    <p>
                        Satisfied with our play, we end the turn. Now it’s up to our opponent to find answers to our threats and adapt his tactics. Will he develop his board by playing more minions? Will he focus on removing ours? Will he bide his time until he can spring a deadly combo on us? Turn by turn, each match becomes more challenging, complex, and fun. What will your strategy be?
